# Billboard

The [Billboard Charts](https://www.billboard.com/charts) calculate the weekly popularity of all songs and albums released in the United States. These metrics are derived from a combination of sources, including the number of singles sales, digital downloads, and a wide array of streaming vehicles (i.e. such as youtube and Spotify). I primarily investigated the Billboard year-end Hot 100 charts, comparing it against the Digital Sales, Streams, Radio and Album charts that Billboard also provide. My data analysis is  investigates the below questions:

* Is there a correlation between singles success and album popularity?
* Which artists were most dominant across the decade?
* Who were the up & coming artists in the 2010s?
* How heavily weighted are digital sales, radio success and streams in the calculation of position on the hot 100 charts?

The data analysis was created using R. Please visit the flexdashboard [here](https://ishaan-gupta-au.github.io/Billboard/) to view my data analysis.
